## CHANGE MANAGEMENT PLAN

### Guidelines for the adoption of the Alpha WEB Ecommerce Application.

This document provides guidelines for the integration of the E-commerce Web application into a small business environment.

Business in the modern day is being done without the presence of a vendor and the customer in the same place. Most of the sales are done online through websites where the customers can access any store with their fingertips. Gone are the days of traveling to a shopping center to view and purchase a product. Especially with the impact of a pandemic like COVID 19. Customers are preferring to shop online in the comfort of their homes. And businesses that do not have an online presence are losing the market share of customers.
Scope: This eCommerce application acts as a template for business that wants to integrate their business online and can expand their customer base. This will not only improve sales but also the user base. Having an alternative way to access a business is always beneficial as the sales can keep happening even if the other location is down. Customers can access the site 24/7.

To run and maintain the Website a computer engineer is required. The engineer shall be trained to use the application and basic maintenance operations will be taught. A well-documented pdf that provides a step-by-step description of application usage shall be provided. 

#### The documents shall cover the following topics:
•	Creating a customer profile and how to set an ideal password.
•	Adding and Updating the Products.
•	How to give limited access to specific users like staff and customers.
•	How to navigate through the web application.
•	Navigation through the backend and all the essential functions.
•	How to place an order?
•	How to add an account to receive payments for the customer purchases.
•	Different payment modes integration like Debit and Credit Cards.
•	Periodic maintenance guidelines.

This engineer can be hired by the business entity or can be appointed by our organization (which is recommended) as he/she is vital for the website to function properly. Once the website is up and running. Physical staff can be downsized in the store based on customer traffic. This helps in saving the company money and resources. The website can be easily integrated into the business ecosystem without disruption to the existing business model. The website is easily scalable based on the user traffic which shall reduce the maintenance costs of the website.

The business can also choose one of the two popular options to integrate the website into their Business.
1.	One Time Purchase: The website once built shall be sold along with the copyrights to the business based on the business requirements and the business is responsible for the proper functioning and maintenance of the website.
Note: Customer Service shall be provided if needed on a periodic basis with a fixed fee.
 
 
2.	Subscription Service: The website shall be built and maintained by our organization and based on the business requirements, changes can be made to the website. This method helps the business to not worry about the functioning of the website. This Subscription service provides 24/7 customer service.


Any issues that occurred shall be notified to us. Our technical team shall provide on-site assistance in resolving the issue.
